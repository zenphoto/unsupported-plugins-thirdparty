# Unsupported third party Zenphoto plugins

This is an archive of third party plugins we store because they have been abandoned by their original developers. 

Readme files or script comments will describe their use and these plugins are also listed on our site's extensions section:
http://www.zenphoto.org/news/category/extensions

Please remember that these scripts are provided for your use and education but are not actively supported and maintained by the ZenphotoCMS team. Many of these plugins are quite old and may not work correctly with current ZenphotoCMS versions.

Although we don't actively support these, we welcome contributions via pull requests or even taking over development. Please read the contributor guidelines: http://www.zenphoto.org/news/general-contributor-guidelines#providing-themes-and-plugins

## Usage

Plugins are folders found in the `plugins` folder. They would be placed in the `plugins` folder of your installation. 

Note that what should be copied is the content of the folder. This will typically be a PHP script and a like-named folder with other content. The PHP script needs to be in the root of the "plugins" folder.

##License
Most of the contents is **GPL v2 or later** licensed, e.g. those created by current or former ZenphotoCMS team members. But since there are also third party solutions collected *please see each tool for its exact licensing*.
